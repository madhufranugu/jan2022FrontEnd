        <dt>Hematology</dt>
        <dd>Hematology is the study of blood and blood disorders. ... These include blood and bone marrow cells. Hematological tests can help diagnose anemia, infection, hemophilia, blood-clotting disorders, and leukemia.
            A hematopathologist is usually board-certified in both anatomical and clinical pathology and has additional years of training in hematopathology. Hematopathology is not only the study of disease of the blood and bone marrow. It is also the study of the organs and tissues that use blood cells to perform their physiologic functions. These include the lymph nodes, the spleen, thymus, and other lymphoid tissue. The hematopathologist focuses on the diagnosis of conditions of the hematopoietic and lymphocyte-rich tissues. This is usually done by direct exam of tissue and blood in the lab.
